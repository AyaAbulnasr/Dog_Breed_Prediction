# Dog_Breed_Prediction
Using Convolutional Neural Networks CCN
## Project Overview

In this notebook, we could identify either the provided image is for a dog or a human or neither. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
Using CCN algorigthims, it's possible now to recognize the dog image with almost 78.1100% accuracy with epochs=80.
Also, I used InceptionV3 for transfer learnings
